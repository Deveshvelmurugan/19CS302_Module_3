# EX 13 To write a C program to read the elements and print only the odd elements in the 2D array.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to read the elements and print only the odd elements in the 2D array.

## Algorithm
Start.
Define a variables i,j,n,a.
Write program to find n x n matrix.
Read the value using scanf.
Ask the user to make an input
Print out the answer.
End.

## Program:
```
/*

*/
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
int i,j,n,a[10][10]; 
scanf("%d",&n); 
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
{ 
for(j=0;j<n;j++) 
{ 
scanf("%d",&a[i][j]); 
} 
}for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
{ 
for(j=0;j<=n;j++) 
{ 
if(a[i][j]%2==1) 
{ 
printf("a[%d][%d] is %d \n",i,j,a[i][j]); 
} 
} 
printf("\n"); 
} 
return 0; 
}
```

## Output:
<img width="724" height="347" alt="441027214-a7a4bda7-4898-40f2-ace5-fed774f524ab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed12d56-3e0f-46e4-ad95-e61c7a9cf98e" />

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
